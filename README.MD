# Starting The first report

1) First step i'm taking is making a summary of “The 6-Week Builder's Gauntlet” guide provided
so I don't forget the core concepts and fundamentals in my project report

2) Second thing is making a Project report document on how i plan my project

Then i will start uploading my code and updating the Project report as it gets developed

# Take a project from an idea to reality in 3 weeks

 what matters more is how you build it.  Become familiar with : 

● Git: You can't build seriously without it. 

● Architecture: have a fundamental understanding of how to structure a project. 

● Self-Management: have some system for organizing your work. 

# Week 1: The Blueprint
    
● The 6-Week Plan: 
Create a week-by-week  milestones and deliverables  schedule

● Tools & Technology
What frameworks, libraries, and platforms will you use? Justify your choices

● Research
understand the landscape before you build on it.

# Three Pillars of a Builder

1) Technical and personal foundation
   
Document Everything on GitHub

Log Your Hours: hour-by-hour what you worked on


2) Adaptable **Problem-Solving** Engine
   
● Build from Scratch: The project must be new, preferably in a field you're unfamiliar

● Embrace Tech Integration: Intentionally incorporate a technology you’ve never used before.

● Think About Your Thinking: When you get stuck. What is your process? 

Do you ask Google randomly? Do you read docs? 

Analyze your own problem-solving steps and identify what works

● Ask Smart Questions: When you must ask for help, do it effectively. Clearly state the problem, what you’ve already tried,

3) Motivation
	
Define Your Drive:  Be honest with yourself. What is your motivation? 

    ● Is it to   create value and solve a real problem? 

    ● Is it to   be the go-to person who can solve any technical challenge? 

    ● Is it to   build a better life for yourself or your family?

    Find your reason. Write it down. 


When you are debugging at 2 AM and nothing works, this is what you will come back to.
